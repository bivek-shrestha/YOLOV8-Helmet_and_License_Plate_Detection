# YOLOV8-Helmet_and_License_Plate_Detection




Python, YOLOv8




Our project focuses on Nepali Number Plate Recognition and Helmet Detection. Leveraging advanced machine learning, we have made significant strides in achieving precise number plate recognition. The project also includes pioneering efforts in dataset preprocessing for robust helmet detection models, contributing to enhanced enforcement of helmet usage regulations.

Key accomplishments include the successful implementation of an OCR system for Nepali number plates and comprehensive dataset preprocessing for helmet detection. Looking ahead, our project envisions expanding model capabilities, exploring real-time video integration, and consistently refining system accuracy.




Methodology

YOLOv8s model trained on our custom dataset detects motorcycle, car, bus, truck, license plate, and helmets. The detected objects will be  tracked using DeepSORT.The license plate is fed to the character segmentation module, and the segmented characters are sent for recognition. The output given by the character recognition model is annotated along with the plate in the video frame.
